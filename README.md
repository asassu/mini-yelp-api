Note: This is a small example of the yelp API working with something that has it's own server, made by Andrea Sassu for the use of Group #3 in UCDD.

Some of the naming conventions are weird (see: color instead of something like business or resturant) for the sake of being a different name.

Please use this either as a reference or to build off of. This currently does not use any jQuery.
